Hey, it's Onur.

I'm a self-taught programmer and have way too much interest in complicated stuff. The name of this blog "Overanalyzed" refers to my default instinct.

These days I'm with [TextCortex](https://textcortex.com).

I'm also a contributor at [Manim Community](https://manim.community/). See [my GitHub](https://github.com/osolmaz).

I post only important updates on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/onusoz).


[Here are some notes from my academic past.](/blog/notes)
